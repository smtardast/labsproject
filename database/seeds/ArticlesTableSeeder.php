It is a vigorous and free flowering peony. The heavy flowers will benefit from some sort of support, but this is more than worth the effort. Its eloquent appearance will take centre stage in any garden setting or flower arrangement. 

        //     Queen Elisabeth, grandmother of now King Albert II of Belgium, was named in honour of her father's sister, Empress Elisabeth of Austria, better known as Sissi. Kindly hearted and a lover of the arts, it is no wonder that she became the patron of the Queen Elisabeth Competition. This internationally renowned competition for young and talented musicians will mark its 75th birthday in 2012.
